General Health Chatbot
Task Objective
The goal of this project is to build a conversational chatbot capable of answering general health-related questions in a safe, responsible, and user-friendly manner.

It provides informative responses without offering direct medical advice or prescriptions.

It encourages users to seek professional medical help for serious or urgent concerns.

Dataset Used
This chatbot does not rely on a fixed dataset for training.
Instead, it uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct model from Hugging Face and is guided by carefully crafted system prompts to ensure safe and relevant answers.

Models Applied
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 â€“ A large language model fine-tuned for following instructions and generating helpful, coherent answers.

Integrated via Hugging Face Inference API for real-time conversational responses.

Key Results and Findings
Successfully integrated a safe query filter to block unsafe health-related topics (e.g., self-harm, overdose).

Generated context-aware and concise responses while maintaining a safe conversational tone.

User tests showed the chatbot provides relevant, informative answers and appropriately defers to medical professionals for serious health conditions.
